job.description = """
The prep steps for the Short Trajectory MD (STMD) protocol based on
a prepared protein and a set of posed and prepared ligands as input.
The ligands need to have coordinates, all atoms, and correct chemistry. Each
ligand can have multiple conformers but each conformer will be run separately
as a different ligand.
The protein needs to be prepared to MD standards: protein chains must be capped,
all atoms in protein residues (including hydrogens) must be present, and missing
protein loops resolved. Crystallographic internal waters should be retained where
possible. The parametrization of some common nonstandard residues is partially supported.
Given the inputs of the protein and posed ligands,
the complex is formed with each ligand/conformer
separately, and the complex is solvated and parametrized according to the
selected force fields.

Required Input Parameters:
--------------------------
ligands (file): dataset of prepared ligands posed in the protein active site.
protein (file): dataset of the prepared protein structure.

Outputs:
--------
out (.oedb file): file of the solvated complexes with parameters.
