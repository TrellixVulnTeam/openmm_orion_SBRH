The Analyze Protein-Ligand MD floe analyzes the trajectory from MD simulations
on protein-ligand complexes.
Trajectories from different starting poses of the same ligand are combined and
analysed collectively.
One analysis is in terms of interactions between the
ligand and the active site.
Another looks at clustering the ligand positions in the protein active site
after fitting the trajectory based on active site C_alphas.
Ensemble MMPBSA calculations are carried out on the trajectory and
are localized to the ligand clusters.
An HTML floe report is generated for each ligand summarizing the results.
