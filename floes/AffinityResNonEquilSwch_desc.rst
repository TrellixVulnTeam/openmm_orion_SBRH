This floe compares experimental ligand binding free energies with
those calculated by Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES).
Only ligand affinities common to both experimental and calculated
datasets can be compared.
Since the calculated affinities are based on RBFE calculations,
they need a reference free energy offset: this floe aligns
the mean of the calculated affinities with the mean of the
experimental data for the ligands in common.
In additon to the output dataset from the NES floe, this floe
also requires as input the dataset for the bound ligands used
as input in the NES floe: the enables an output dataset to be
written from this floe
which contains the realigned calculated affinities.
This floe also produces two floe reports of the same form as
those generated by the NES floes, one for the calculated
RBFE edges (transformations of Ligand A into Ligand B), and
one for the realigned calculated affinities.
