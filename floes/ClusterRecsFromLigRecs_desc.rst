This Floe converts the results dataset from 
Protein-Ligand MD Analysis,
which is ligand-centric containing cluster information inside,
into a cluster-centric dataset.
This dataset allows individual clusters to be selected in
the Orion UI so they can be separated into a new dataset
or carried forward to another floe.
